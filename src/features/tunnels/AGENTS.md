# Tunnels (`src/features/tunnels`)

Provider-neutral tunnel plumbing. This first slice holds the tables, one
adapter per provider and the routes that connect a provider account and its
API tokens. No tunnel, portal or doorway route exists yet.

## Tables

`carrier` (a provider account an organization connected), `badge` (one API
token on a carrier), `tunnel`, `portal` (one server running one connector) and
`doorway` (one hostname a tunnel carries). Created in `0005_tunnel_tables`.
Nothing in a table name, column or migration says Cloudflare: the provider is
a value (`TUNNEL_PROVIDERS` in `vocabulary.ts`, pinned to the CHECK
constraints by `src/db/enum-checks.test.ts`). Adding a provider is one new
member there, a widened CHECK (forward migration) and one adapter.

- `tunnel.datacenter_id` is nullable and only says what `placement = 'all'`
  means (every server of that datacenter). It does not limit a tunnel to one
  datacenter, and `portal` is keyed by (tunnel, server) with no datacenter
  constraint. The code that adds a portal requires the server to be in the
  tunnel's datacenter for now; that rule lives in code so it can be relaxed
  without a migration.
- `placement` is read from `portal`: `chosen` is the servers with a `run`
  portal, `all` is every server of `tunnel.datacenter_id` except those with a
  `skip` portal, `one` is exactly one `run` portal. `portal.reported`
  (`unknown`, `connected`, `down`, `error`) is separate from `wanted`. A
  server runs many tunnels and tunnels of several organizations may share a
  server, so the key is (tunnel, server) and nothing assumes one tunnel per
  server. `portal.options` is reserved for per-server details (for example a
  local endpoint).
- `tunnel.organization_id` owns the tunnel; `tunnel.routing_organization_id`
  is the organization whose servers and sites it carries (named as on
  `hostname`). They must be equal for now: `assertSameHostingOrganization`
  refuses a difference, and no CHECK enforces it, so it can be relaxed without
  a migration. A tunnel can reach other organizations' hostnames on a shared
  server; that is a documented risk, not isolated per tunnel.
- The connector program is not a column: `tunnel.options.connector` names it
  (`cloudflared` for the Cloudflare provider) while only one exists. Each
  server reports the version it runs in `portal.connector_version`, with
  `portal.version_checked_at` for when, so the panel can show program and
  version per tunnel per server.
- `doorway` keeps the hostname text and a nullable `hosting_id` (SET NULL). It
  is unique on (`routing_organization_id`, `hostname`), because a doorway with
  no hosting is not in `hostname` and one name must not sit on two tunnels in
  one organization. It has no foreign key to `hostname`:
  `replaceHostingHostnames` deletes and reinserts a hosting's hostname rows on
  every save. The doorway code path must return the same 409
  `hostname_in_use` when either table already holds the name. The hostname
  must be lower case and 1 to 253 characters (a CHECK); format is validated in
  code with the existing hostname validator.
- `tunnel` is unique on (`carrier_id`, `external_id`) so two rows cannot stand
  for one provider tunnel. `placement = 'all'` needs a `datacenter_id` (a
  CHECK), and the datacenter delete route answers 409 `datacenter_has_tunnels`
  while an `all` tunnel covers it.
- Delete behavior of every new foreign key: organization deleted removes its
  carriers, tunnels and doorways (cascade, both organization columns on
  `tunnel`); server deleted removes its portals; tunnel deleted removes its
  portals and doorways; carrier deleted removes its badges and sets `tunnel.carrier_id` NULL, but the
  route refuses it first (409 `carrier_in_use`) while a tunnel uses it; hosting deleted sets `doorway.hosting_id`
  NULL; datacenter deleted sets `tunnel.datacenter_id` NULL. A `secret` row is
  never removed by the database: removing a badge deletes its secret in code
  (`deleteBadge`) and removing a tunnel deletes its run-token secret
  (`deleteTunnelRecord`); `badge.secret_id` is CASCADE and `tunnel.secret_id` and
  `tunnel.carrier_id` are SET NULL. RESTRICT and NO ACTION were tried and
  rejected: Postgres checks them per cascaded statement, and an organization
  delete removes `secret` and `carrier` before `badge` and `tunnel`, so they
  fail it.
- `carrier` is unique on (organization, provider, external account id); a
  provider with no account stores NULL, and NULLs never collide.

## Tokens

A token is never stored in these tables. `badge.secret_id` (and later
`tunnel.secret_id` for the run token) points at a `secret` row whose
`secret_envelope` is the token sealed with `encryptSecret`. `secret.provider`
is `carrier_badge` for an API token and `tunnel_run` for a run token, neutral
so a new provider never widens `secret_provider_check` again (widened once in
`0005`; the vendor is in `carrier.provider` / `tunnel.provider`). Because the tokens are
`secret` rows, the at-rest re-encrypt sweep (`src/admin/reencrypt-secrets.ts`,
the `secrets` stage reads every row of `secret`) already covers them; there is
no new sealed column. Removing a badge or carrier deletes the `secret` rows in
the same transaction.

A badge row keeps the label, the last four characters and what the token
reaches. Responses and audit rows carry only those. Provider errors are
scrubbed by `TunnelProviderError` (known secrets, bearer values and token-shaped
runs are redacted) before they are logged, audited, stored or returned.

## Adapter

`adapter.ts` is the interface: check a credential, create a tunnel, fetch or
rotate the run token, set routes, create or remove the DNS name, delete a
tunnel. `cloudflare-adapter.ts` builds on `cloudflare-client.ts` (a small
typed client over an injected `fetch`; tests never call the real service).

- A credential is checked with read calls only (accounts, zones, tunnels,
  DNS records) and the report says what succeeded. A read proves the token
  reaches that area, not that it can edit; edit rights are confirmed by the
  first write. Certificate rights cannot be seen by a safe read and are
  reported as not shown. The accounts and zones lists may be refused to a
  narrow token; that is treated as empty, not as a bad token.
- Routes always point at `https://localhost`; the last ingress rule is a
  catch-all with no hostname.
- Rotating a Cloudflare run token is not confirmed against the API, so the
  adapter reports it as unsupported rather than guess an endpoint.

## Routes

`src/client/organizations/carrier-routes.ts`, `organization:manage` like backup
targets: `GET|POST /organizations/:id/carriers`, `DELETE .../carriers/:carrierId`,
`GET|POST .../carriers/:carrierId/badges`,
`DELETE .../badges/:badgeId`, `POST .../badges/:badgeId/check`. Adding a
badge checks the token first and refuses one that cannot do anything useful,
naming the missing permissions. OpenAPI: `src/client/openapi/tunnels.ts`.
